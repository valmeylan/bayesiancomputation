# Bayesian computation



MATH-435 Bayesian computation, lectured by Prof. Dehaene, is an EPFL graduate course.

Summary
This course aims at giving a broad overview of Bayesian inference, highlighting how the basic Bayesian paradigm proceeds, 
and the various methods that can be used to deal with the computational issues that plague it.

The assessment method was based on a programming project and its presentation.
It was asked to implement three methods presented in class, on a dataset of our choosing.

We had to apply these methods on three qualitatively different models.
